# Audio Files

## Large Audio Files

The following audio files are too large for GitHub and need to be hosted separately:

- `public/Ruskin Bond Essentizls to Life/RuskinBondTheEssentialCollectionforYoungReaders_ep6.mp3` (344.87 MB)

## Recommended Hosting Solutions

### Option 1: Supabase Storage
Upload the audio file to your Supabase storage bucket and update the file path in your application.

### Option 2: Cloud Storage
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage

### Option 3: CDN
- Cloudflare R2
- Bunny CDN

## Implementation

Update the audio file paths in your application to point to the hosted URLs instead of local files.

Example:
```typescript
// Instead of: '/Ruskin Bond Essentizls to Life/RuskinBondTheEssentialCollectionforYoungReaders_ep6.mp3'
// Use: 'https://your-storage-bucket.com/audio/ruskin-bond-audiobook.mp3'
```
